This is a Tic Tac Toe game that I have created using python programming language and the Tkinter module. 
The Tkinter module (“Tk interface”) is the standard Python interface 
to the Tk GUI toolkit. 
Both Tk and Tkinter are available on most Unix platforms, as well as on Windows systems. 
This game is yet by means complete, as I plan to work on this game further and a 
lot more features to make it an interactive and responsive
 experience.

The game currently is in an extremely initial stage. Playing this game, 2 users can play against each other and the winner is decided between them.
The functionality provided by the game includes:
1)When a  button that is already been clicked is clicked again, an informative message is shown to the players.
2)The Players can clear the screen whenever required.
3)The players can enable or disable the undo feature
4)Quit functionality
5)Right clicking on each individual button will undo that button.


The functionality I want to add is :
1) High Scores list to be always displayed and update
2) Statistics as to which symbol between X and O wins the most
3) Allowing players to choose between X and O
4) Saving the state of the game
5) Allowing the players to choose their version of symbols they want to play with.
6) Allowing Customization of background colours
